# Setting Up a Minecraft Server on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

In this project, we will be using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and SSH terminal to create and host a Minecraft server. 
The steps below outline how to set up and configure the server.

## Resources

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
- Virtual Machine (VM) instance running on GCP
- SSH terminal access to the VM instance

## Usage

Once the Minecraft server is set up, you can connect to it using the IP address of the VM instance and the default Minecraft port (25565).
You can also customize the server settings and game modes as needed by going into the SSH terminal and typing

`
nano server.properties
`
