# Setting Up a Minecraft Server on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

In this project, we will be using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and SSH terminal to create and host a Minecraft server. 
The steps below outline how to set up and configure the server.

## Resources

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
- Virtual Machine (VM) instance running on GCP
- SSH terminal access to the VM instance

## Usage

Once the Minecraft server is set up, you can connect to it using the IP address of the VM instance and the default Minecraft port (25565).
You can also customize the server settings and game modes as needed by going into the SSH terminal and typing

`
nano server.properties
`

## Installation

1. Create a new virtual machine instance in GCP and choose the Ubuntu operating system.
2. Connect to your virtual machine instance using SSH terminal.
3. Install Java and screen on your virtual machine instance. 
4. Find Minecraft server software and configure it to run on your virtual machine instance.
5. Open the necessary firewall ports to allow players to connect to your server.
6. Connect to your server using your Minecraft client, enter in the external IP Address and start playing!
